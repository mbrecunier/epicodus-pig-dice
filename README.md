# Pig Dice Game

#### A simple dice game, 01/27/2016

#### By Joseph Karasek and Michelle Brecunier

## Description

Create players and take turns rolling two dice. If both dice show 1, your turn ends and you lose your entire score. If only one die shows 1, you turn ends and you won't earn any points for that round. If neither die shows 1, add the two die values to your score. You can continue rolling until you roll a 1 or choose to end your turn.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Fork and clone it.

## Known Bugs

The total score may not always display correctly after a game reset. Most likely completely fixed. No other known bugs.
